      <p>
        My name is Igor Vieira and I'm a Software Developer from Brazil. I'm
        passionate about technology and discovering new things. This is my
        personal website, where I share my thoughts, save my projects and write
        about my experiences.

        If you want to support me, consider buying me a coffee or donating to my
        Bitcoin Wallet.
