I will continue an old project and also I will start posting from here for everyone who wants to understand more about how to build a product from the beginning. I'm very excited about this project, because I believe this is simple, and it's a good way to create a new product with some profit. I don't need to be the next genius, but I want to create something.

First, I have chosen the technologies: React with Vite, Tailwind, and all this with TypeScript. And I think for all this moment, the next steps I will create all this on my YouTube page. But I will record the entire videos before putting online, because it's very stressful and I prefer to do hard work and after that publish for everyone.

But that's it, and some interesting (some challenges) parts I will dedicate to putting here, I think this will help me in the future.

Thank you for your time, see ya.
