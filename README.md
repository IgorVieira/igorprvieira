## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command             | Action                                           |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn install`      | Installs dependencies                            |
| `yarn dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `yarn build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `yarn preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `yarn astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `yarn astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
